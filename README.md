# blueprint

Sun Microsystems' JDS icons, taken from Christian Medel's (`Elbullazul`)
Icon-resources repository.  
I've taken from there (after asking for him where he got it) since I was
struggling to find these icons on the Net, and I'm reuploading here for backup
purposes.  

## My objective

I just want to keep this as a reference for future artwork in my project
(Pindorama) and for the sake of backup.  
If you're interested in making this work in modern GTK-based desktop
environments (eg.: XFCE), go ahead and fork it. `:^)`

## Licence

For some unknown reason, Sun thought it would be a great idea to licence icons
under GPLv2 along with their GNOME fork, Java Desktop System (JDS); so that's it.  

In my humble opinion, it would be better to keep these under a CC-BY-like
licence or plain Public Domain (like KDE 2 did), but I wasn't there to decide,
neither to design and create the theme.
